## 2025-04-08 - Added Accessible Labels to Svelte-like Component System
**Learning:** This repo uses a bundled/minified Svelte app structure where components are defined with `c()` (create), `m()` (mount), `p()` (update), `d()` (destroy) methods. The generic button component `ae` was missing `aria-label` support. I learned how to identify the component logic (`oe` - instance script) and view (`ie` - fragment) and patch them to accept and render a new prop by mapping it to a specific index in the context array (index 5 in this case).
**Action:** When working with similar pre-bundled Svelte apps without source, look for the `instance` (logic) and `create_fragment` functions. Add props by updating the `props` map in the class definition, adding the prop to the instance function, and then updating the DOM in `c()` and `p()` methods using the context array index.
